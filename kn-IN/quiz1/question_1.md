You created and used a lot of lists in your project. Which of these is the proper way to create a list of animal names?

--- choices ---

- ( )
```python
names = ('cat', 'dog', 'rabbit')
```

  --- feedback ---

  Close! But lists don't use parentheses â€” `()`.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x)
```python
names = ['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit']
```

  --- feedback ---

  That's correct! Lists use square brackets (`[]`) and commas between the items on the list.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( )
```python
names = ['cat' 'dog' 'rabbit']
```

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite, list items are separated by more than spaces.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( )
```python
names = ['cat': 'dog': 'rabbit']
```

  --- feedback ---

  Very close, but lists aren't separated by colons (`:`).
