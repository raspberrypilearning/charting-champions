You created and used a lot of lists in your project. Which of these is the proper way to create a list of animal names?

--- choices ---

- ( ) `names = ('cat', 'dog', 'rabbit')`

  --- feedback ---

  Close! But lists don't use parenthesies — `()`.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) `names = ['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit']`

  --- feedback ---

  That's correct! Square brackets (`[]`) and commas between the items on the list.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) `names = ['cat' 'dog' 'rabbit']`

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite, list items are separated by more than just spaces.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) `names = ['cat': 'dog': 'rabbit']`

  --- feedback ---

  Very close, but lists aren't separated by colons (`:`).
